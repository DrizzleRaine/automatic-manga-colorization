# Manga Colorization In Browser [demo](http://47.98.46.70)

Ongoing web applications for automatic manga colorization with model totally run in browser. 

Built based on [keras.js demos](https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js), Use [Keras.js](https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js) to run Models in everyone's browser.


# Model Training

model is trained with my keras implementation of [cycle-gan](https://github.com/MingwangLin/cyclegan-keras/blob/master/CycleGAN-keras.ipynb), it's based on [pytorch-CycleGan](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) (by junyanz) and [tf/torch/keras/lasagne](https://github.com/tjwei/GANotebooks) (by tjwei).

trained model is converted to Keras.js model by [keras.js Model Conversion](https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js-docs/conversion/)
